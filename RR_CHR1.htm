    that it was more than just the philosophy of emphasizing currents which made the

    fill a gaping format void created when the rush to go A/C was in full swing.&quot;</font></td>

    Filling A Hole</strong></font><br>
    <br>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sparked by the success of
    WCAU-FM and WBBM-FM, KMOX-FM decided to do its own version of&nbsp; 'Hit Radio.' &nbsp;
    &quot;It was almost two years since <strong>KSLQ</strong> decided to go A/C, completing
    the effort by shedding those teen-oriented calls in favor of <strong>KYKY</strong>,&quot;
    recalled Ed.&nbsp; &quot;The hole was almost </font><small>big enough to drive a truck
    through, but no one wanted to fill it.&nbsp; We finally realized that you can only share
    that A/C pie so many ways</small>.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">Tim went on to say, &quot;The
    process of going CHR took almost a year and was complete in August 1982, just after
    malting a visit to WBBM-FM. At that time we were only playing six currents an hour, but
    right after the trip Ed jumped that to about 11.&quot; He drew an interesting analogy:
    &quot;It's like taking a successful Broadway show on the road. It worked in Philadelphia,
    was a smash in Chicago, so why not St. Louis? we asked. KHTR really benefitted by their
    mistakes and from the positive ends of our sister stations' experience with a CHR
    format.&quot;</font><p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed
    admitted, &quot;We had straddled the fence for a long time, and agonized over songs that
    were too hard or too soft for us. We decided that if John Cougar had a hit record, then we
    were going to play it instead of rationalizing if songs were too extreme for us to deal
    with. At that point in our minds we made the jump to CHR.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mentioned that KHTR has done something both WCAU-FM and WBBM-FM
    haven't done - put two up books together. &quot;We'd like to make it at least three,&quot;
    Tim said, &quot;I think it's something we can continue. I think the reason for our upward
    trend is that we're not a duplicate of those stations. We started KHTR where WCAU-FM and
    WBBM-FM have now evolved to. We've had currents, recurrents, and oldies on since the
    beginning. When you look at a Hot Hits station, they're all currents and no oldies.&quot;</font></p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During a candid conversation with &nbsp; PD Ed Scarborough and
    Station&nbsp; Manager Tim Dorsey&nbsp;&nbsp; (who have been in St. Louis for a&nbsp;
    combined&nbsp; total of 14 years),&nbsp; I&nbsp; was able to &nbsp; learn how they went
    about building a powerful new image for a previously colorless station. Along the way,
    both gentlemen shared some interesting thoughts on contests, music, and the CHR format in
    general.</font><p align="left"><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </font><strong><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="3">KMOX-FM To KHTR</font></strong><br>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you live in St. Louis, it's hard not to listen to KMOX (AM) at
    some point in time. The station is almost indelibly etched in the community consciousness
    with its 50kw signal and well-known personalities, which add up to a perennial 20+ rating.
    Then there was KMOX-FM . . . a &nbsp; station with a small budget, no promotion, a
    semi-undefined A/C format, and a big signal with loads of potential. How do you get out
    from under your big sister?<br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There is no question that KMOX-FM for years has&nbsp;been
    in the shadow of KMOX,&quot; remarked Ed. &quot;For that matter, every station in the
    market is in its shadow. What's happened during the last two books is that KMOX is still
    way above everyone with 20 shares, but then KHTR begins the next level of ratings.&quot;
    KMOX-FM debuted with a 6.9 share, changed calls to KHTR, and in the just-released winter
    Arbitron moved up to an 8.8 share, number two overall. In teens, KHTR has an amazing 40+
    adults, in 18-34 it's a strong third, and it's looking healthy in fourth place for 25-49
    adults.</font></td>
