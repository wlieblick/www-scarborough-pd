    <td width="100%" height="19"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LET'S
    LOOK AT THE MUSIC A BIT. DO YOU FIND YOURSELF HEAVILY INTO RESEARCH?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, we call music stores and find out what's selling. We've also done
    some focus groups where we test artist perception but not individual songs, per se.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHAT DO YOU DEPEND ON PRIMARILY FOR YOUR NEW MUSIC SELECTION?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A slightly pudgy belly called a gut. We like to hear how a record
    sounds on this radio station. Does it sound like KKHR? We have a difficult time with
    ballads. We have a much easier time with records that pop.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IT'S A LOT OF FUN TO LISTEN TO - HIGH ENERGY AND YOU USE REVERB AS
    WELL, DON'T YOU?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, we use a slight amount of reverb on the mikes.</p>
    <b><p>COMPARING KKHR WITH OTHER STATIONS IN THE MARKET, WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST STRENGTH?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think consistency is one of our earmarks. You can punch up 93 on the
    FM dial at any time and you're going to hear a hit. You're going to hear something that's
    relatively familiar and what you hear between the records will be fun and energetic ...up,
    bright and positive.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HOW BIG A PLAYLIST DO YOU HAVE?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can print it on an 8 X 10 piece of paper.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I THINK I'D TRUST YOU WITH THE FORMULA FOR THE ATOMIC BOMB THE WAY
    YOU PROTECT INFORMATION! DO YOU PLAY OLDIES AND HOW FAR BACK?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some oldies and not too far back, only a few years.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHAT IS A PERFECT KKHR PROMOTION?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something that sounds good on the radio and something our audience
    wants, can relate to, would really like to have ...that makes it perfect. I'm talking here
    about a prize promotion. A couple of things come to mind that were quite successful. We
    have &quot;KKHR Hit Nights&quot;, call them midweek release, where one night a month we go
    out to local bars and kind of party all night long, giving away records and t-shirts and
    have freeze dances, play &quot;Simon Says&quot; and things like that. It gives us a chance
    to get out and get one-on-one with our people and ask them questions about the radio
    station. In the way of contests, I like the KKHR &quot;Free Ride&quot; and even though I
    brought that here from St. Louis, it's a natural tie-in with the commuter s-ituation here.
    That's what we call our music sweeps and as a contest we simply redefine the free ride and
    for an entire month we gave away a motorcycle a day and a 10 Speed bicycle a day, capping
    it off with everybody who won one of these qualifying to win the ultimate free ride - a
    Toyota 4 X 4. That was a big promotion and I'll tell you, programming couldn't have pulled
    it off without sales - they were remarkable, putting aside what they needed to do and
    saying, &quot;OK, let me work on this for you.&quot;</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ARE YOUR JOCKS PERSONALITES?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think so. At times we get comments that they're not and that
    irritates me to no end. Again, it gets back to how you define a personality and I've never
    defined a personality as someone who gets paid by the word. If that's how others define
    personality, then no, we are not. Our guys are concise and they get to the point but by
    golly, they sure pack it in. They make you laugh and I guess that would make them
    personalities. Our audience is part of our personality - we put them on the air.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU PUT PHONES ON THE AIR?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If somebody calls up with a good bit or the jock can make a good bit
    out of it, we'll pop them on the air.</font></td>
