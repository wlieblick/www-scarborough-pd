    <td width="100%" height="19"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AS YOU
    KNOW, WE PUBLISHED AN INTERVIEW WITH BOB VANDERHEYDEDN A FEW WEEKS AGO. FROM YOUR POINT OF
    VIEW, HOW MUCH INDIVIDUAL CONTROL DOES THE INDIVIDUAL STATION HAVE OVER PROGRAMMING AND
    HOW MUCH IS CORPORATE DICTATE?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think you just hit the nail on the head in terms of the success of
    the CBS FM division, and that is that we have diversity among the radio stations. I
    remember years ago when the RKO stations were on top that people would come by and say,
    &quot;The program director of the group hasn't decided whether to add it or not.&quot; You
    remember those days when one guy held the key to 7 radio stations. That's never the case
    with the CBS FM division. Bob Hyland, president of the FM division, just does not run the
    group that way. His feeling is the individual stations and their GM's hired competent
    program directors who are in their market and they know what's going on. I can tell you
    that Bob Hyland and Bob Vanderheyden have never issued an order or dictated to do
    something or play something. They allow each PD in his own market to decide what's right.
    And as a result, while there are similarities between the five Top 40 stations in the
    group because we subscribe to similar philosophies, none of these radio stations sound the
    same.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHAT KIND OF INTERACTION DO YOU HAVE BETWEEN THE PROGRAM DIRECTORS
    AND THE NEW YORK OFFICE?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would say the relationship could be best defined as supportive. I
    deal mostly with Bob Vanderheyden, our program director. My GM, Bob Nelson, deals more
    with Bob Hyland, although I feel free to call him whenever I want to ask questions or
    whatever. Supportive is the key word. As I mentioned earlier, they never come with
    dictates, they come with questions and then they open debate on them. If we get into a
    bind, whether it's a budgetary problem or I want to run a contest and I can't get it past
    somebody or we've got to bend a rule a little bit to get this through, Bob Hyland's going
    to be there to see what he can do and Bob Vanderheyden is going to be there pitching him.
    Our Director of Marketing and Research in New York is Cathy Seipp and she's tremendous.
    She's the one who says, &quot;Let's look at these Arbitrends. Let's talk about the
    Arbitron and see what this book is really telling us about your radio station. Let's go to
    Maryland together and look at the diaries.&quot; She's right there telling us exactly what
    we need to know in terms of how our radio station is actually doing. Besides making that
    Arbitron book translate into everyday English for us, Cathy helps coordinate the in-market
    research we do - focus groups and so on. So when we look at New York It's not one of those
    home office things where you think, &quot;Gees, I've got to get this through New York
    before 1 can get it anywhere.&quot; We're talking about people who are here to help us out
    and every one of us treats it in that manner.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DO YOU HAVE GROUP CONFERENCES AND CONFERENCE CALLS AND IF SO, WHAT
    DO THEY DEAL WITH?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The CBS FM PD's get together 2, maybe 3 times a year for B.S.
    conferences. As far as phone conference calls, we do them when there is a topic that Bob
    Hyland and Bob Vanderheyden would like us all to think about. More often than not, I feel
    free to pick up the phone and call Rick Peters or Scott Walker or any of my other
    counterparts and ask how they're handling something and we bounce ideas off one another.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">LET'S PULL OUT YOUR PERSONAL LIFE SCRIPT AND LOOK AT TOMORROW FOR
    YOU.</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I really don't have any major goals or aspirations, and that's the
    God's honest truth and I'll tell you why: When I was a jock at KSD I always said it would
    take a stick of dynamite to blow me out of there, I loved that radio station so much, I
    would have never left it for any kind of monetary offer. I had it firmly in my mind that I
    was music director, then I would become program director and then God knows what from
    there on. I had layed out a kind of order to my life and the net result was that the
    station was sold and I was just left out in the cold with all my plans. I swore at that
    point that, as trite as it is, I've got to take it a day at a time. I feel that I'm happy
    doing what I'm doing and if I succeed at it then I'm sure it will lead me somewhere that I
    want to be taken.</p>
