    FACTORS DO YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">The kinds of music that work for a radio station out here are totally
    different from a radio station back in St. Louis.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">WHAT IS THE WAY TO THE HEART OF LOS ANGELINOS - ONE KEY THAT UNITES ALL
    THESE TRANSPLANTED PEOPLE WHO LIVE OUT HERE FROM ORIGINS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND BEYOND?</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="left">Boy, that's a tough question and I don't know whether I have an answer
    for you on that one. Perhaps it is that there isn't one universal factor and perhaps we
    shouldn't try to lump everyone too much together. People in Orange County have different
    tastes than people in the San Fernando Valley and so forth.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><b>SO HOW DO YOU REACH THEM THEN?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">If I had that answer I'd be a genius, wouldn't I?</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><b>YET YOU ARE REACHING THEM.</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">But not by being a genius, I just work darned hard as do all the people
    around me and we're slowly making those inroads. I think the most important thing we've
    found here is that the music tastes are much more open and much more liberal and not as
    clearly defined as they would be in other markets. We can get away with playing a greater
    variety of music out here as opposed to walking a fine line and saying, &quot;Well, this
    is the Midwest and we can't play this but we have to play that.&quot; Here it really
    doesn't work that way.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><b>A LOT OF PEOPLE READING THIS ARE IN L.A. ATTENDING THE CONVENTION AND
    GETTING READY TO SAMPLE THE STATION. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE TO THEM THE SOUND AND
    PHILOSOPHY OF KKHR?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">I guess the philosophy of the station is quite simple: Play the hits -
    don't water them down too much, just play the hits. How we define &quot;hit,&quot; of
    course, is a difficult question and that's the age-old battle of radio. What to expect in
    terms of the sound of this radio station - well, just look for a radio station that sounds
    like everybody's having fun and it's contagious. If our guys laugh and have fun on the
    station then you will too.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="left">ED, YOU'VE GOT A REALLY ELECTRIC, HIGH ENERGY, DEDICATED STAFF FROM
    DAVE HALL, YOUR MUSIC DIRECTOR WHO'S ONE OF THE NICEST, MOST DEDICATED RADIO PEOPLE I'VE
    EVER TALKED WITH, TO JACKSON ARMSTRONG (JOE CIPRIANO USING WHATEVER NAME HE'S USING
    THERE)...</p>
    </b><p ALIGN="left">Dave Donovan.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><b>...EVERYBODY THERE SEEMS TO HAVE AN INFECTIOUS, EXCITING INVOLVEMENT.
    IT STARTS WITH YOU AND GOES RIGHT THROUGH THE RANKS AND I GET THE FEELING THAT EVERYBODY'S
    THERE ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT BECAUSE THEY LOVE IT AS A LIFESTYLE. HOW DO YOU, AS A
    PROGRAMMER, CREATE THAT?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">That's not far from the truth. We were very, very fortunate that we
    stumbled onto the right combination of people. I don't have to tell you that you sometimes
    bring in a guy on the basis of his air work but when he gets there you just cannot get
    along and the next thing you know you have all kinds of in-house squabbles with the staff.
    That gets across on the air. When one Jock cross-plugs another he starts taking potshots
    at him and the audience is perceptive enough to realize they're not just in jest. Here our
    guys really care about this radio station and if there's anything they can do to help it
    out, they're going to do it. This is career time and they're professionals who take their
    business seriously but have enough fun with it so that it works.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><b>WHAT HAVE YOU DONE DIFFERENTLY IN LOS ANGELES FROM WHAT YOU DID AT
    KHTR?</b></p>
    </font><p ALIGN="left"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1">I would honestly answer that by
    saying that when we fired up KKHR I don't think we were that different from what I left
    behind in St. Louis. The difficulty was that St. Louis evolved to a certain point and then
    I left it. Then I came to Los Angeles and said, &quot;Now how do I pick up where I left
    off?&quot; It's hard to remember how I got there over that period of time. We started KKHR
    very similar to St. Louis both musically and in jock presentation. However, over a period
    of time as I got better acclimated to Los Angeles and got a better feel for what was
    happening here, the radio station itself started to evolve in terms of jock presentation,
    wider limits of fun, a party-type atmosphere. Certainly our music direction changed quite
    a bit as well.</font></td>
