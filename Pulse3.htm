    assume you can't go on forever avoiding any forward action because of fear of breaking the
    back of your station's roots. What kind of research do you plan to try and determine which
    is baby and which is bathwater?</font><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" size="4"> </font><font
    FACE="Arial" size="3">We've done market studies since I've been here in an effort to
    understand the community perception of the station and our competitors, just to get a feel
    for what is and what should be.</font><p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q</font><font
    FACE="Arial" size="3"><strong> And from those studies you found what</strong><b>?</b></p>
    </font><p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"> We
    found that people were essentially happy with K-Lite, had perhaps a tendency to take it a
    bit for granted, a little bit of concern over repetition of music and a lack of variety in
    the depth of our artists.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"> <strong>To
    which he reacted by broadening the music and highlighting the personalities, as you
    mentioned earlier. Let's do some vital statistics on you--age, where you're from and so

    size="3">&nbsp; I'm 37, from Hartford, Connecticut. My first job was at WINR, Binghamton
    in 1968 when I was a junior at Ithica College. I graduated college and went to WHYN in
    Springfield, Massachusetts where I worked for a year and a half as a jock. From WHYN I
    went to WCCC in Hartford and worked weekends at the same time at WBZ in Boston under the
    name &quot;Ed Mitchell.&quot; Then from there, Charlie Parker at WDRC, Hartford hired me
    and I worked there from 1973-76. From WDRC I went to KSD in St. Louis, spent three years
    there, then it was sold to what was then Combined Communications-now Gannett and they
    converted it to a news station. I found myself as Music Director of an all-news radio
    station and thought I'd better try moving on-so I went over to KMOX-FM in St. Louis. I was
    Morning talent for KMOX-FM and then some other shifts over about a year and a half period
    there, then about that time Bob Hyland took over the group from New York and Bob
    Vanderheyden became VP/ Programming for the CBS FM Group and they came to St. Louis and
    sought out opinions-including mine-and a decision was then made to promote me&nbsp; and
    give me a shot at programming the radio station. I took it over as KMOX-FM, an A/C for
    about two books, changed call letters to KHTR and evolved to Top 40 and the rest is
    history-it just exploded.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><strong>
    Did you know when you first took over the KMOX </strong><b>FM PD job that you'd be going
    Top 40 with it?</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"> No, that
    decision came later with CBS-FM stations in Philadelphia and Chicago exploding for us.
    Ironically I argued against the switch to Top 40. I felt there was only one other A/C in
    the market-KS-94, and my concern was that if we dropped out of the A/C ballgame, we'd be
    handing over one huge piece of pie to KS-94. Shows you what I know. </font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</td>
    <td width="50%"><font FACE="Arial" size="3">Then I was transferred to Los Angeles, KKHR,
    in 1983 after taking KHTR from a 3.4 to a 6.9 to an 8.8 to a 10.6, then I left to go to
    L.A.<br>
    <b><br>
    </b></font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>Why
    didn't KKHR in Los Angeles</b><strong> work, as you look at it in retrospect?</strong><br>
    </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"> You
    know, I don't know that it didn't work. I think that unfortunately KIIS in Los Angeles is
    and was such a monster radio station that it overshadowed the accomplishments of KKHR.
    Let's not forget that KKHR did break into the top 10 in the marketplace and had a cume of
    well over a million people per week and was one of the top seven or eight cuming radio
    stations in America. We accomplished a great deal there, but unfortunately for the big
    picture it wasn't enough for the long run. The biggest problem KKHR continually faced was
    market awareness-seven out of ten people perhaps didn't even know we were on the air, and
    you just can't win when that much of the marketplace doesn't know you're there.</font><p><font
    face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"> <strong>While you
    were at KKHR, did you give serious thought to going urban? I know it was pitched to you by
    Don Kelly.</strong></p>
    </font><p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"> We
    beefed up our urban mix, and we toyed with turning it over to an urban format-thought
    about it a lot. For a variety of reasons-and sound reasons-we passed up that alternative.
    We didn't think it was the right thing for that particular radio station to do considering
    the heritage of CHR background in CBS and the sales staff was scaled to sell CHR.</p>
    </font><p><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q</font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><strong>
    Do you miss being on the air? You were an air talent for so long.</strong><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font> There are times when I miss it. You know
    I read somewhere an article about how Bill Drake was blamed for ruining the air
    personalities of America, and I think that's very unfair. If the Drake format did one
    thing for radio personalities it was it taught them to think, and there are times when you
    just hear mistakes being made on the air and you say to yourself, &quot;I was a jock for
    11 years and I never made that mistake-I could make a fortune now being a jock.&quot; So
    sometimes I miss it for the wrong reasons, I think. When you're a jock, you're frustrated
    that you don't control your destiny-you get fired for all the wrong reasons or no reason
    whatsoever. The ratings go down and the jock gets blamed, so the mentality says &quot;I've
    got to stop being a jock and become in control of my own destiny' Then you become Program
    Director and have all those other worries and you say, you know, I should have stayed as a
    jock.</p>
    </font><p><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="6">Q</font><font FACE="Times New Roman"
    SIZE="1"> </font><font FACE="Arial" size="3"><b>But you like what you're doing overall?</b><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font> Absolutely, of course. There couldn't be
    a better group to work for and with than CBS and this team here. I like the market, the
    potential and the heritage of K-Lite, and I'm enthusiastic about what we're achieving
    here.</font></p>
