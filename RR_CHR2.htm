    KHTR, and it didn't make sense to spend a ton on old calls.&nbsp; We finished number two
    in the market as KMOX-FM, and became an even stronger number two as KHTR.&quot;</small><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>He elaborated on what the station did during the winter book.
    &nbsp; &quot;Heavy TV, outdoor and print media in January.&nbsp; We lightened up in
    February, and then heavied up at the beginning of March toward the end of this sweep,
    going into the spring book.&nbsp; We have an average of 400 GRP's of TV time a week and
    periodically will drop back to a maintenance schedule during the Spring book.&quot; &nbsp;
    What he's describing is similar to a &quot;pulse&quot; advertising plan, which gives TV
    viewers the impression that the advertisement is still being seen even in a week where it
    doesn't appear.</small><hr size="5" noshade>

    <strong>KHTR's Hit Music Mix</strong><br>
    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">To get a
    better idea of the formatics of KKHR, I asked Ed for some percentages in his music
    categories. He told me that in a typical hour the station is 70% current, 20 % recurrent,
    and 10 % oldies. Heavy rotations move every two or two and half <b>hours, </b>mediums
    every four hours or so, and lights every five or six. Recurrents turn twice a day and
    oldies once every couple of days. <b>&quot;We'd rather play a killer oldie than fill in </b>with
    fluff. KHTR uses the RCS Selector System, which helps to rotate things so that our cume
    doesn't burn. It can make invisible to habit listeners.&quot;</font><font
    FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><br>
    </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the area of
    recurrents can be pretty nebulous, I asked Ed for his definition. &quot;I call a recurrent
    any record that won't die. For example, some songs have just fallen off the chart but have
    a great deal of airplay left. And there others like Joan Jett's 'I Love Rock N Roll' that
    still are incredibly strong for us.&quot;</font><br>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </font><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">Almost
    No Dayparting</font></strong><br>
    <font size="3"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></font><font FACE="Times New Roman"
    size="2">This brought me to the subject of dayparting, or lack of dayparting in this case.
    Ed's thinking is reminiscent of the early Top 40 philosophy on this issue. &quot;Joan Jett
    gets played 24 hours a day. There is very light dayparting, with few exceptions. My
    reasoning is that if I like it at 7pm, won't I like it at 6am? I think we (as an industry)
    started looking over our shoulder and second guessing ourselves too much,&quot; he
    reflected.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most programmers might ask, &quot;Can an adult take this
    record?&quot; Ed responded, &quot;My primary concern is that the station sounds consistent
    in the morning, afternoon, and at night. If we aren't, then the people that tune in for
    one thing will hear something they're not expecting in another daypart and we'll end up
    satisfying very few in the long run.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With that, I asked Ed for a description of the station and its
    texture. &quot;I would describe it as a pop-AOR as opposed to a pop-A/C. We do lean to the
    harder side of things, as we consider our competition to be AOR (KSHE and KWK). KHTR
    avoids the softer things like Stephen Bishop, the new Toto, or the Ronnie Milsap. We will
    be early on a record like the Tubes or a Night Ranger-type of song. As a result we are
    sharing with KSHE, KWK, and KY98.</font><br>

    </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">Although the Midwest tends to be slow on
    black crossovers, Ed's attitude is more positive. &quot;Yes, we play black crossovers.
    We'll play the Dazz Band, Irene Cara, Lionel Richie, and Michael Jackson. We're not afraid
    of black music as long as it has a pop feel to it.&quot;</font><p><font

    ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed added,
    &quot;At the same time I think that our 'Quick Cash' contest was instrumental in helping
    things along. KHTR gave away $20,000 in January using our 'phrase that pays' contest. We
    wanted to get our 'Hit Radio' image across, and we also wanted to develop some
    brand-loyalty to the station. The simplest way to do that was to give the impression that
    the audience owned us. So we used the phrase 'KHTR Is My Hit Radio.' All they had to do
    was be the designated caller to win the cash.&quot; The simple idea for the contest came
    out of focus group research conducted by KHTR.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The station has just finished giving away a Schwinn bike every
    day for 28 days, a Honda motorcycle for 28 days, and of those 56 winners, one person will
    be given a brand new Mustang convertible. The station also involved itself with a bumper
    sticker campaign with Burger King, but interestingly enough there was no particular
    contest or incentive to win. And the results? According to Ed, &quot;Astonishing. We've
    gone through our initial shipment of 100,000 stickers in only four weeks, and now we're
    printing up another 100,000. The first shipment went in only four weeks. All we did was
    tell the audience it was time to show St. Louis that KHTR was your hit radio
    station.&quot;</font></td>
