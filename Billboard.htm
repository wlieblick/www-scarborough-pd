    FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">-LITE IS THE ONLY station in the history of CBS to repair
    itself without a format change,&quot; says AC KLTR Houston PD Ed Scarborough, discussing
    his station's turnaround since 1986, a rebound that took place with few staff changes.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Scarborough arrived from KKHR Los Angeles in 1986, KLTR was
    third out of four FM ACs and had dropped twoshares in less than a year. With KFMK, KJYY,
    and KQUE in the market - and KKHT set to join the AC fray a year later-K-Lite needed a
    fixed position.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarborough's game plan was to first get KLTR's product &quot;in line
    with our image&quot;-one of a &quot;friend&quot; that a listener could relax with, or take
    to work. Then to turn the personalities from &quot;background&quot; into real people;
    emphasize music that appealed to the older end of his target demo; and market the station
    heavily</font><font SIZE="1" FACE="Times New Roman">.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">Since that time,
    however, KFMK and KJYY have gone oldies. KKHT is &nbsp; now Top 40 / dance KNRJ. And
    KLTR&nbsp; has&nbsp; risen 4.2 - 5.5 in the summer Arbitrons, up from a 3.7 two books
    ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarborough grew up&nbsp; in West Hartford, Conn., started in
    radio during college, and eventually became MD of an all news station.&nbsp; &quot;I
    didn't see much future in it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He went crosstown to CBS's KMOX-FM as PD, but his career really
    took off after the AC station became KHTR during a top 40's renaissance in 1982. &nbsp;
    &quot;It's like we</font><small> were on a rocket ship,&quot; he says of the station's
    dramatic 3.4 - 10.6 rise.&nbsp; &quot;At that time, the CBS combo [KMOX/KHTR] had a third
    of the numbers in the market.&quot;</small><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br>
    <small><small>&nbsp; </small>&nbsp; </small><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">But in
    1983, Scarborough was transferred to Los Angeles, where &quot;mellow rock&quot; KNX-FM was
    about to become top 40 KKHR, and the rocket ride suddenly came to a halt. Facing KIIS-FM
    at its 10-share peak, KKHR was constantly outgunned by its rival. &quot;We were battling a
    station that had a $3-million promotional budget,&quot; says Scarborough. &quot;We had a
    $356,000 promotional budget, including TV. We went to war with rubber bullets.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, Scarborough is quick to point out KKHR's achievements.
    &quot;People often fail to realize that KKHR cumed over a million people in its first
    year, and that's amazing. We may have failed on the surface, but it's a miracle we kept it
    up for three years in that competitive environment,&quot; he says. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When KKHR became KNX-FM again in 1986, Scarborough went to
    Houston and had to readjust to an AC mindset, which, he says, was not a problem, because,
    &quot;I'm more in the AC audience . . . .Although now I don't have to care when a new
    Madonna record comes out, there are just as many pressures in AC radio as there are in top
    40.&nbsp; The hardest [part] is that there's just no way to tell if a current is working.</font></td>

    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KLTR's&nbsp; marketing&nbsp; efforts&nbsp; have centered&nbsp; around
    &nbsp; its&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequent&nbsp;&nbsp; Listener &nbsp;&nbsp;
    Club,&nbsp; one&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; earliest &nbsp;&nbsp; such<br>
    promotions.&nbsp; Club&nbsp; members are contacted&nbsp; by&nbsp; mail on a &nbsp;&nbsp;
    regular basis&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; are&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; only&nbsp; ones &nbsp;
    eligible&nbsp; to&nbsp; win&nbsp; station&nbsp; contests. &quot;There are no losers &nbsp;
    in our contests,&quot; says Scarborough.&nbsp;&quot;If&nbsp; a club member doesn't call
    within <br>
    an&nbsp; allotted&nbsp; time,&nbsp; we'll&nbsp; send&nbsp; them&nbsp; two&nbsp; concert
    &nbsp; tickets anyway.&quot;<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarborough says the club, which now boasts 35,000 members;&nbsp; has
    been &quot;a marvelous marketing tool.&quot;&nbsp; FLC promotions, according to
    Scarborough, are good for an automatic increase in TSL; cume is built by other means,
    including TV and mailouts to non-members.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At&nbsp; present,&nbsp; KLTR&nbsp; does&nbsp; not &nbsp;&nbsp;
    really&nbsp; have&nbsp; a&nbsp; direct competitor:&nbsp; &quot;Classic Hits&quot;&nbsp;
    KFMK&nbsp; plays&nbsp; few currents;&nbsp; KQUE plays an odd mix of AC and adult
    standards; and easy listening KODA &quot;has modified its music somewhat and is now
    stepping on our turf.</font><br>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I realize that right now we're on top of the game, and<br>
    a&nbsp; lot&nbsp; of&nbsp; people are responsible for that,&quot; he says.&nbsp; That <br>
    includes our GM Miles Sexton, who has been &quot;a guiding <br>
    force in the marketing&nbsp; of&nbsp; this&nbsp; radio station,&quot;&nbsp; the
    &quot;brass&quot; <br>
    at CBS in New York who&nbsp; have&nbsp; given &quot;tremendous moral and financial support
    as well as the patience to let us turn<br>
    this thing around,&quot; and KLTR's air staff.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;I'm&nbsp; a&nbsp; realist regarding K-Lite and&nbsp; its
    &nbsp; future growth,&quot; says Scarborough.&nbsp; &quot;My personal&nbsp; goal for
    &nbsp; the station is just to defend our turf.&nbsp; The challenges will&nbsp; constantly
    be coming at us. Good&nbsp; PD's&nbsp; are&nbsp; the ones who maintain&nbsp; the &nbsp;
    numbers,&nbsp; not necessarily those who achieve them. &quot;</font><font SIZE="1"
