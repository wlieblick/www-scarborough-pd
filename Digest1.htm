<p><font SIZE="-1">By Burton Allan Miami-West Palm Beach Chief Correspondent</font></p>

<p>I guess it is that time of year again. Time for spring cleaning, and radio is no
exception.</p>

<p>Spring cleaning began a little early this year at Majic 102.7 (WMXJ-FM) as longtime
program director Ed Scarborough tendered his resignation. No replacement has been named.</p>

<p>Scarborough's resignation comes at a curious time, as stations are gearing up for the
spring Arbitron ratings period. Most advertisers and broadcasters look to the spring book
as the most important ratings period of the year for determining advertising buys and
rates. Most stations save their best promotional packages and contests and fresh formatic
adjustments for this time of year, as well. Radio follows a pattern similar to automobiles
and real estate, which also go all out at this time to generate the most passion among the
people for their products.</p>

<p>Scarborough's comprehensive background in radio includes expertise in the CHR and adult
contemporary formats, as well as oldies. In addition to his work with Majic 102.7,
Scarborough has programmed prestigious radio stations such as KHTR in St. Louis, KKHR in
Los Angeles, and Houston's KLTR. .</p>

<p>While full-time daypart personnel moves are rare in the oldies format, program
directors and morning-drive hosts come and go frequently, and Scarborough's run at Majic -
almost six years - was a long one in the usually short life span of a program director.</p>

<p>Under Scarborough's tenure, Majic had undergone several changes in its morning-drive
presentation. Two of the more prominent morning acts that Scarborough used were Sonny Fox
and Bill Neil. Fox has worked mornings just about everywhere in the market, including his
current gig with KISS, while Neil's background includes WNSR in New York.</p>
