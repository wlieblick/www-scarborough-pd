    came to KLTR-Lite-the CBS owned FM station in Houston in June from programming KKHR, Los
    Angeles which, upon Ed's exit, became KNX-FM with a classic rock bent. You came into town,
    Ed, almost six months ago. Aside from unpack the U-Haul and find a house, what was the
    first thing you did at the radio station?</b><br>
    </font><font SIZE="6" face="Bookman Old Style">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> The
    very first thing that happened to me here at K-Lite was that our VP/General Manager Bob
    Sexton called a general staff meeting to welcome me to the radio station and introduce me
    to all the personnel. A little background here, my predecessor as PD, Steve Matt, had
    taken over as PD about the time CBS took over the station, and he felt that he'd taken the
    station about as far as he could and offered to step down. In a really generous gesture,
    he said he'd like to remove himself from the programming position and turn that over to
    somebody who could take the station the rest of the way and would like to continue staying
    at K-Lite and do his morning show. That's what created the opening here for me.<br>
    </font><font SIZE="6" face="Bookman Old Style">Q</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><b> You
    and Bill Minkler put together the format that switched KKHR to KNX-FM in Los Angeles, but
    if this situation hadn't beckoned here in Houston, would you have stayed in Los Angeles
    and run KNX-FM?<br>
    </b></font><font SIZE="6" face="Bookman Old Style">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">
    Yes. The decision was mine to come here if that's where you're going with that. Thinking
    about my needs and the needs of my family, I thought this was a good opportunity and a
    good time to move on.<b><br>

    FACE="Arial" SIZE="6"><strong> </strong></font>You converted two CBS-FM stations &#150;

    </b>That was the big buzz &#150; that lookout K-Lite &#150; here we go rock and roll. Of
    course, that was never the intention not is it. Look at all the CHR &#150; there&#146;s a
    new entry in the market just this month.<b><br>

    FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><b> </b>Sure, we play about 20 currents. But it&#146;s so wonderful
    not to have the intensive of having to run for a brand new record when it comes out. But
    sure, we have a playlist and we rotate a portion of our current playlist more often than
    another portion &#150; we program in tiers just like any radio station.</font><br>
    <font SIZE="6" face="Bookman Old Style">Q</font><strong><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> Do
    you pick and program your music based on charts or research or what?</font><br>
    </strong><font SIZE="6" face="Bookman Old Style">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> We
    look at all the charts to be aware of the records that are being released and records that
    are being worked.</font><br>
    <font SIZE="6" face="Bookman Old Style">Q</font><b><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> You say
    &quot;worked&quot; &#150;I&#146;ll be the first thing you found when you got out of LA and
    out of CHR was that the record people found you virtually invisible.</font></b><br>
    <font SIZE="6" face="Bookman Old Style">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> You've got
    that right. When you're as spoiled as I was by the excellent record service in Los
    Angeles, you really can't understand when nobody does handstands down here. In all
    fairness to the labels, I assume our format isn't as important to them as CHR either.
    There are several labels who do service us well, and there are several who I've never seen
    or heard from or received product from since I've been in town. I called them, too. I
    would have expected, though, that the record community would make it their business to
    visit and find out about any new PD coming into their territory. True, before I came here,
    K-Lite didn't play a lot of current and new music, but I do and I really hope to see and
    here from record people what the priorities are. It isn't that we're not worth it
    either-we went out of the box on Human League, Ric Ocasek, Toto and a number of other
    tunes that went on to be big hits.</font><br>
