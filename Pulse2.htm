    FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><strong>Do you play jingles?</strong><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font> No, no jingles. When this station was
    owned by Gulf, one of the things it was founded on was a very clean sound. For years
    K-Lite was &quot;Lite Rock, Less Talk&quot; and all the things that went with that-fewer
    interruptions and disturbances, no hype, gimmicks, and part of that meant the production
    on the radio station had to be very low key and thus, no jingles. We've considered jingles
    recently but we really want to be sure it's the right thing to do before we actually go
    with anything like that.<br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q</font> <strong>Going into a new market like
    Houston, how did you evaluate the station and the market and the positioning of one within
    the other?</strong><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font> I did a lot of long, hard talking and
    listening in particular to everybody in the station-not just the air staff but everybody,
    top to bottom, getting a feel for the history of the station and what was wrong and what
    was right.<br>
    </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">Q </font><strong><font face="Arial"
    size="5"><small><small>And what was wrong?</small></small></font></strong><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"><font
    face="Bookman Old Style"><font size="5"> </font></font>Primarily there was a lack of
    cohesiveness, a lack of teamwork among some of the staff. Also there was some question as
    to the direction of the station as to where it was going. There'd been some philosophical
    changes in the direction of the station and there seemed to be some confusion there.<br>
    <font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="6">Q </font><b>What was right with the station?</b><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A </font>The station has great personnel,
    excellent market position, and good numbers that had taken a hit recently but that we're
    hoping to build back up in a book or two. It's a fine radio station that only needed a
    little bit of fine tuning.</font></td>

    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="6"> </font><font
    FACE="Arial" SIZE="3">My Assistant PD, Steve Matt along with<br>
    our News Director, Betsy Ballard, do the morning show. The show has the feel of <br>
    K-Lite but with a lot more presence and information in it. Our news is in the morning show
    and again we have news in afternoon drive . . . 60 second news updates. We also<br>
    get traffic information via computer screen <br>
    and we pass that along as something <br>
    comes up.<br>

    What's the secret of a good music balance in a Lite Rock station? </b></font><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> That's one of
    the things we're still feeling <br>
    out. We're learning that in Houston and, I suppose, in every market, the audience is
    fractionalizing in terms of A/C. Transtar <br>
    Format 41 is in Houston now on KJYY, and <br>
    we have an oldies station in town, so for this A/C to succeed, we felt it would be best to
    remember that we are Lite Rock not Lite <br>
    A/C and we backed off the Kenny Rogers<br>
    and Barbra Streisands and Barry Manilows<br>
    and have become a little more hip in our <br>
    A/C music.</font><p><img src="Images/pulse_4.jpg" alt="wpe2.jpg (14260 bytes)" align="top"

    call </b><strong>your air staff personalities?</strong></font><br>
    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> If you'd
    asked me that when I got here, I'd have said no. We've had a lot of meetings since then
    and it's our opinion that for any of these Lite-Rock stations to succeed we have to give
    this station a bit more warmth and believability and hence more personality so we can
    develop some listener loyalty. That means moving away from the jukebox approach and
    bringing the air personalities more into the forefront with relevant things to say to our
    target audience. We're working on that right now.</font><br>

    your music?</b><br>
    </font><font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> We do
    play 30 minute music sweeps every hour, but we do bring in the jock in between those
    songs-it's not like 30 minutes of no talking.</font><br>

    <font face="Bookman Old Style" size="6">A</font><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="3"> I don't think
    it's any one ingredient. I think we've achieved a very comfortable balance that has given
    us a very good image with the community. We have a reputation as a radio station that's
    reliable and dependable, plays pleasant music and doesn't get in the way of your day.</font><br>
