    <strong>Record Store Impact</strong><br>
    <big><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></big><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2">Naturally,
    the record companies were thrilled that a hit-oriented radio station was back in the
    market, but Ed told me of one record store in particular that saw immediate reaction.
    &quot;Streetside Records commented to us that when we add records, they can tell within
    two weeks if it's going to be a hit. The biggest problem we have is that many outlets are
    racked by sources outside the market, and that serves as a sense of frustration.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Retail sales are very important as well as some key
    stations on a national basis. We also pay close attention to MTV. From the beginning, vise
    used the phrase 'in touch' in conjunction with our request lines. From day one we took
    requests as serious input, so St. Louis literally told us what they wanted to hear. Every
    request is logged. The most important factor is that the record sounds like KHTR, or it
    doesn't get on the air,&quot; Ed stressed.</font><font FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><br>

    Advertiser Reaction</big></big></strong><br>
    </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2"><big><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big></big>St.
    Louis is a very conservative town, and Missouri is known as the &quot;Show Me State.&quot;
    What about advertisers and their reactions to the format? Tim replied, &quot;Had we done
    this on our own, or been the first to try this, then I'm not sure what advertiser reaction
    would have been. But since some of our own stations broke the ground for us, the opposite
    took place. The success of WBBM-FM and WCAU-FM caused the agencies to take a quick look,
    and the early monthlies from Birch confirmed we were on the right track. Our rates are
    higher now than when we were A/C and we carry more inventory on a consistent basis than
    before.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ed told me that commercials on the station are limited to a
    maximum of nine units and only three stops an hour. &quot;We do our promotional
    announcements outside of stop sets, which allows our jocks the freedom to get involved
    with what's going on and at the same time have more fun with station content.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lineup is very familiar to St. Louis, with the exceptions of
    morning man <strong>Bob Scott,</strong> who came from <strong>WKRC/Cincinnati</strong> and
    afternoon personality <strong>John Frost</strong> from <strong>WHYT/Detroit.</strong>
    &nbsp; Middays is <strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong> (ex-<strong>KSLQ, KS94</strong> and <strong>KADI</strong>),
    nights features <strong>K.C. Van Allen</strong> (<strong>KADI, KXOK</strong>), and
    all-nights is Craig Roberts </font></td>

    size="2">Remember when radio stations had a representative at each high school? Well, KHTR
    calls them &quot;ambassadors,&quot; as Ed explained. &quot;We're on the streets every day,
    especially at the schools. We have an ambassadors program at each high school. One person
    is our rep, who helps us direct the flow of station information into the school and
    information about the school back to the station.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;We have also brought a St. Louis legend, Bob Kuban (who had
    a hit in the mid-60s called &quot;The Cheater&quot;), back into the limelight. He'll be
    leading the `Hit Radio Band' which will be all over town at different parks and events.
    We've also been involved with the March of Dimes `Walk America,' and later this summer
    will participate in the Like Cola `Run For Youth.' We're making every effort to get out
    and mingle. KHTR is going to be everywhere.&quot;<br>
    </font><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="3"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Not A Fad Format</strong></font><font FACE="Times New Roman" size="2"><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based on the rumored switch of Doubleday's KPKE, Denver from AOR
    to CHR, I asked Ed about his feelings regarding a similar switch by KWK or any other St.
    Louis station to CHR. &quot;Personally, I welcome competition. When you're in a footrace
    and you look over your shoulder, then you're going to be caught. The best thing we can do
    is remain true to our purpose and focus . . . this will cause us to evolve naturally. We
    have to continue to make the market react to us.&quot;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concluding our conversation, I asked Ed if he thought the new
    trend toward CHR was just another fad or simply broadcasters rediscovering a format that
    works when properly executed. &quot;I don't think this is just a fad we're going through
    right now. Are Y100, Q105, or Z93 just a fad? Hardly. They've done nothing but play the
    hits irk their markets for years while everyone else got off base.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;These are the stations that watched everyone else change
    while they remained on course, just as we plan to do.&nbsp; Fortunately, today's music has
    helped us accomplish this since it's become so exciting.&quot; Ed likened it to the music
    around 1963, just prior to the <strong>Beatles</strong>.&nbsp; He then echoed a bit of
    formatic philosophy which seems to be gaining ground among CHR programmers.&nbsp; &quot;We
    don't have to be everyone's favorite station to win, but with a high cume and some brand
    loyalty we can be alot of people's second favorite and come out number one.&quot;<br>
