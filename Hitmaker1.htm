    <td width="100%" height="19"><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="1"><b>YOU&#146;RE A NEW ENGLANDER,
    AREN&#146;T YOU?</b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was born and raised in West Hartford,
    Connecticut.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">YOU GOT TO WORK IN YOUR HOMETOWN VERY EARLY ON.</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, I had the good fortune of working at a station that really was,
    and still is In many ways, a legend: WDRC in Hartford, the station that boasted talents
    like Joey Reynolds, Jim Nettleton, Long John Wade and his brother Don Wade and Ron Landry.
    WDRC had so many great people go through that station! I sat in that chair, always
    wondering, &quot;What do I do? Do I really belong here?&quot; it was a real kick for me
    working in my hometown and particularly at WDRC.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WHERE DID YOU ACTUALLY START IN RADIO, ED?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first job I got during my college years. I went to school at Ithaca
    College in upstate New York and I was the program director of the college station there,
    WICB.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A GREAT COLLEGE STATION THAT WAS, TOO ...GOOD EQUIPMENT AND IN THE
    ERA I REMEMBER IT, THEY HAD DRAKE SOUND-A-LIKE JINGLES - REALLY WELL DONE.</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was and I assume it still is, a college that takes its broadcasting
    seriously and that was the era I was in school there - we had the &quot;Fake Drake&quot;
    jingles and we tried to mimic the format and really learn radio, not just play radio. One
    afternoon I fielded a phone call from a program director in Binghampton, New York asking
    if I knew of anyone who might want a summer job at WINR Radio. &quot;What a
    coincidence,&quot; I said, &quot;you're talking to someone who could certainly use an
    opportunity.&quot; I landed that summer job there, my first break into commercial radio.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SO YOU WORKED THERE FOR THE SUMMER THEN WENT BACK TO COLLEGE IN THE
    FALL?</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Right. I had two summers in Binghampton at WINR and was invited back
    there, as I recall, after graduation from college. My feeling was that I'd had two summers
    there and if I go back after graduation, where do I go from there? So I took a chance and
    took a summer fill-in job at WHYN in Springfield, Massachusetts. That was in 1971.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ANOTHER NEW ENGLAND LEGEND LIKE THE BIG D!</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Absolutely! The station owns Springfield, Massachusetts. The fill-in
    turned into a permanent job and I stayed there for a year and a half, then moved into
    Hartford where I worked at WCCC for a brief while, then joined WDRC in 1973.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SO YOU WORKED FOR THE GREAT CHARLIE PARKER THEN.</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had the privilege and the pleasure, yes.</p>
    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">THAT WAS THE ONLY STATION HE EVER WORKED AT FOR 20 SOME-ODD YEARS!</b></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That's right. I believe he started in the mail room back when WDRC was
    not even in Hartford, but in New Haven or somewhere, and they were a network station
    playing all the network programming. A real legend &#150; we used to say Charlie Parker
    has forgotten more about radio than most people ever knew. Charlie was big time radio even
    though it was Hartford and I don&#146;t think you&#146;ll find a major jock on the East
    coast who didn&#146;t somewhere go through Charlie Parker&#146;s door. He was a real
    innovator with the contests he created . . . secret sounds, mystery words. Things like
    that all originated at his doorstep.</font></td>
