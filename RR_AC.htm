    overlooked, production can be a key element in a station's overall success. Programmers
    from large, medium, and small markets emphasize the importance of this programming
    component, but are frequently frustrated in the search for AC-compatible production
    elements.</font><br>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As part
    of his plan to protect KLTR's environment, Scarborough evaluates all spots, and has turned
    some away. &quot;We've told many advertisers their commercial isn't acceptable to our
    product. Coors Light, for example, has some pretty hard-edged jingles.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the three spots they sent us, we sent two back. Agencies cut
    different spots for Country, CHR, and UC. We have to educate them to do the same for AC.
    As with all things, it will take time. Local advertisers want messages that scream `Buy,
    buy, buy' or `Save, save, save.' We request that these spots be toned down and
    recut.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus far, no KLTR advertiser asked to alter a spot has told the
    station to take a hike. &quot;Everyone has accommodated us,&quot; Scarborough said.
    &quot;We tell them we know the audience and how to reach it. Our clients always cooperate
    with us in some fashion.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KLTR's jazz offering, &quot;K-Lite Cafe,&quot; airs evenings and
    Sundays during brunch hours. The station runs certain spots <i>outside </i>the show that
    it deems unacceptable <i>within </i>it.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Cafe' has a pop feel,&quot; Scarborough&nbsp; reasoned.
    &quot;We're selective with the music. There's nothing abrasive, there are no hard guitar
    licks, and the tempo is fairly controlled. The Cafe' needs to provide a relaxing
    environment. The last thing we want to do is burst someone's bubble by blowing the
    illusion of this relaxing haven. Some spots fit in one environment, but not in the
    other.&quot;</font></td>

    Scarborough. &quot;The music we put into commercials and promos has to match the station's
    environment, which must always be protected. Music we place under commercials sounds like
    songs we'd play on the station throughout the day.&quot;</font></font></p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding
    a production library to fit the bill isn't easy. &quot;We've evaluated about 15 libraries
    within the past two months,&quot; Scarborough reported. &quot;We're having a hell of a
    time finding one that's suitable for AC. I don't know what some of these people are
    thinking when they're laying down tracks. Tracks tend to be heavily laden with rhythm, and
    aren't geared to ACs. Not all ACs play heavy dance product, yet production companies lean
    to some weird sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></td>

    <font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Companies use lots of
    fuzz guitars on tracks. I'd venture to guess 70% of ACs wouldn't touch guitar licks like
    that. Production packages that companies claim&nbsp; are&nbsp; AC&nbsp; are<b> </b>often
    pretty off-the-wall. One package we received&nbsp;&nbsp; had&nbsp;&nbsp; brass&nbsp;&nbsp;
    and &nbsp;&nbsp; string sections which [made it sound] like it came from the '60s.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;When looking for music beds, Scarborough hunts
    for pieces with unobtrusive melodies. &quot;They have to&nbsp; have&nbsp; texture, &nbsp;
    feel,&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; some&nbsp; rhythm.&nbsp; But&nbsp; they&nbsp; shouldn't have
    melody getting&nbsp; in&nbsp; the way.&nbsp; We've heard production beds with wailing
    saxophones. Do they expect me to put that&nbsp; kind&nbsp; of&nbsp; music&nbsp; under
    &nbsp; a spot?&quot;</font></td>
